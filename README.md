My practise Golang Repo

To use this repo dir on your local repo create a .bashrc file under your home directory mentioned below :

```

export GOPATH=$HOME/Desktop/vscode/go # don't forget to change your path correctly!
export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

```
